## Description
This script allows you to easily insert a videogame note into your Obsidian vault using [Quickadd plugin](https://github.com/chhoumann/quickadd) by @chhoumann. **Now also works on Mobile (make sure you use latest QuickAdd) !**

We use IGDB api to get the videogame information. 

This script needs a **client id** and **client secret** for IGDB API that you can get [here](https://api-docs.igdb.com/#about). Steps to obtain **client id** and **client secret** are detailed [below](#how-to-obtain-client-id-and-secret).

## Disclaimer

The script and this tutorial are based on [Macro_MovieAndSeriesScript.md](https://github.com/chhoumann/quickadd/blob/master/docs/Examples/Macro_MovieAndSeriesScript.md) by @chhoumann.

**Please never run a script that you don't understand. I cannot and will not be liable for any damage caused by the use of this script. Regularly make a backup of your Obsidian's vault !**

## Installation
![igdbInstall](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52013479/150051891-f9330609-8521-402a-97f1-3288bb4186f3.gif)

0. Make sure you use latest QuickAdd version (at least 0.5.1) !
1. Save the [script](https://github.com/Elaws/script_videogames_quickAdd/releases) to your vault somewhere. Make sure it is saved as a JavaScript file, meaning that it has the `.js` at the end.
2. Create a new template in your designated templates folder. Example template is provided below.
3. Open the Macro Manager by opening the QuickAdd plugin settings and clicking `Manage Macros`.
4. Create a new Macro - you decide what to name it.
5. Add the user script to the command list.
6. Add a new Template step to the macro. This will be what creates the note in your vault. Settings are as follows:
    1. Set the template path to the template you created.
    2. Enable File Name Format and use `{{VALUE:fileName}}` as the file name format. You can specify this however you like. The `fileName` value is the name of videogame without illegal file name characters.
    3. The remaining settings are for you to specify depending on your needs.
7. Click on the cog icon to the right of the script step to configure the script settings. This should allow you to enter the API client id and client secret you got from IGDB. **Please make sure no accidental spaces are inserted before or after API `client id` or `client secret` !**
8. Go back out to your QuickAdd main menu and add a new Macro choice. Again, you decide the name. This is what activates the macro.
9. Attach the Macro to the Macro Choice you just created. Do so by clicking the cog âš™ icon and selecting it.

You can now use the macro to create notes with videogame information in your vault !

## Dataview rendering

Here is the dataview query used in the demo (replace `PATH` by your videogames notes path) :

```dataview
TABLE WITHOUT ID

("[[" + file.name + "|" + Title + "]]") AS Title,
Date,
Genre,
Modes,
("![coverImg|100](" + Thumbnail + ")") AS Cover,
("![DeveloperLogo|100](" + DeveloperLogo + ")") AS Developer,
Release,
URL,
Recommender,
Comment,
Rating

from "PATH"
```

The banner at the top of the document is rendered using [Obsidian-banners](https://github.com/noatpad/obsidian-banners) plugin.
